Accordingly, Nietzsche’s reputation in the English-speaking world is now arguably the highest it’s ever been, and his place in philosophy’s canon looks assured.However, it wasn’t always this way. After suffering a mental breakdown in 1889 from which he never recovered, Nietzsche (and his works) came under the care of his sister, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, who was a bigoted anti-Semite.Elisabeth warped Nietzsche’s unpublished notebooks and unfinished works (now collected in The Will to Power) into a bloodthirsty call to arms for nationalist Germany, which aligned to the blueprint for Hitler’s ‘superior’ Aryan race.For a long time, therefore, Nietzsche’s ideas were synonymous with those of Nazism.Thankfully, the truth of Elisabeth’s tampering emerged — as did letters and earlier works evidencing Nietzsche’s fierce opposition to nationalism and antisemitism.Following the Nazi defeat in World War II, efforts were made to sanitize Nietzsche’s name, not least by the philosopher, translator, and poet Walter Kaufmann.Kaufmann recognized that Nietzsche was majorly misunderstood in the English-speaking world, and set out on a long-term campaign to not only provide new English translations of all of Nietzsche’s works, but also guide readers in better understanding the profundity of his ideas.(For more on the key events of Nietzsche’s life and legacy, including his tragic descent into insanity, see our overview of Nietzsche’s life, insanity, and legacy, which places his philosophy in the context of his life and illness, ultimately suggesting that Nietzsche’s task in both his personal life and his wider philosophy were one and the same: to find meaning in suffering, to make recovery more predominant than resentment, and to establish a solution to the problem of nihilism.)

Even enjoying a resurgence in popularity, however, Nietzsche’s philosophy remains commonly misunderstood, misread, and misappropriated by those from all over the political and philosophical spectrum, who wish to elevate their particular cause with the power of his rhetoric.

With a range of thinking so widespread, and a style of writing so stunningly and wickedly provocative, it is perhaps no surprise that Nietzsche’s iconoclastic, hammering utterances — designed to jolt people out of presuppositions — can be so grossly taken out of context.

Here is a thinker who not only changes his mind on key topics throughout his active philosophical period, but who at times suggests he doesn’t want to be understood, not to be purposefully oblique, but because he thinks his readers are not yet ready for what he has to say.

Getting into Nietzsche, then — i.e. really understanding and appreciating his philosophy, rather than just a few of his most famous quotations — can be somewhat of a challenge.

For, far from helping his readers by clearly laying out his ideas in rigid, structured form, Nietzsche prefers to challenge us by scattering his great ideas across his works — often offering only hints and winks about what he truly thinks, and occasionally contradicting himself or reevaluating earlier ideas.

Nietzsche also primarily adopts an aphoristic writing style — presenting us with a numbered sequence of rather disconnected sentences and paragraphs across a whole range of different subjects, sometimes held together by a particular theme, sometimes not.

There may be a paragraph from an 1881 work that aligns to something he then expands on in an 1887 work, for example.

Nietzsche also writes in such a way whereby he assumes you’ve read everything he’s ever written — as well as every major Western thinker from the ancient pre-Socratic Greeks onwards.

Given the quirks involved in reading him, selecting a ‘first’ Nietzsche book can be tricky. While they all contain diamonds, and while his writing style is always stunningly engaging, there is perhaps no ‘single’ work of his that stands out as an easy gateway to his ideas.

That said, some are certainly better candidates than others.

As we discuss below, his 1889 work Twilight of the Idols, for instance, is often recommended as a better starting point than most, for Nietzsche attempts to offer short summaries of his mature philosophy.

The 1887 On the Genealogy of Morals, too, can be a more accessible first read than others, in that Nietzsche foregoes his aphoristic style for the production of three longer-form essays, making for a more conventional initial reading experience (though, for first-time Nietzsche readers, understanding the subject matter will most definitely be a challenge without the assistance of some secondary literature, the best of which we outline below).

Perhaps the worst route into Nietzsche’s thinking, meanwhile, is the one most commonly taken: starting with his most famous book, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, written between 1883 and 1885.

While Thus Spoke Zarathustra is a stunning literary achievement, it is not the best way to learn about Nietzsche’s ideas, for it is more a densely cryptic expression of them in poetic, lyrical form.

Another common approach is to start with Nietzsche’s first book, The Birth of Tragedy — but this is also not recommended.

While the germ for many of his later ideas can be found in The Birth of Tragedy, on the whole it is not representative of his most important contributions to philosophy, for Nietzsche’s style and ideas develop considerably in his later works.

Taking into account all of the above, the below reading list consists of the best and most essential books for those looking to understand more about Nietzsche and his fascinating philosophy.

It contains a mix of both primary and secondary literature, for although Nietzsche’s words always make for a brilliantly entertaining read themselves, tying together Nietzsche’s ideas — scattered as they are across his works — can be a real challenge.

Indeed, if you’re interested in learning about Nietzsche as a first-time reader of his books, the power of his ideas is more accessible when contextualized by scholars whose life’s work has been dedicated to understanding him.

If you want to understand how the life Nietzsche lived led to the production of his philosophy, this is the biography for you.

Both an introduction to and a sustained commentary on Nietzsche’s moral philosophy, Brian Leiter’s 2002 book Nietzsche on Morality has become one of the most widely used and debated secondary sources on Nietzsche over the past two decades.

Focusing on morality but touching on related topics too, Nietzsche on Morality is a solid overview and critique for anyone interested in Nietzsche’s philosophy.

Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn't have to be that way.
Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code on the fly into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer but only if you work at it.
What kind of work will you be doing? You'll be reading code - lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what's right about that code, and what's wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.
Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code - of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and "smells" gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.

Literature is any collection of written work, but it is also used more narrowly for writings specifically considered to be an art form, especially prose, fiction, drama, poetry, and including both print and digital writing. In recent centuries, the definition has expanded to include oral literature, also known as orature much of which has been transcribed. Literature is a method of recording, preserving, and transmitting knowledge and entertainment, and can also have a social, psychological, spiritual, or political role.

Literature, as an art form, can also include works in various non-fiction genres, such as biography, diaries, memoir, letters, and essays. Within its broad definition, literature includes non-fictional books, articles or other written information on a particular subject.

Etymologically, the term derives from Latin literatura "learning, a writing, grammar", originally "writing formed with letters", from littera "letter". In spite of this, the term has also been applied to spoken or sung texts. Literature is often referred to synecdochically as "writing", especially creative writing, and poetically as "the craft of writing" (or simply "the craft"). Syd Field described his discipline, screenwriting, as "a craft that occasionally rises to the level of art."

Developments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, which now include electronic literature.

Definitions of literature have varied over time. In Western Europe, prior to the 18th century, literature denoted all books and writing. Literature can be seen as returning to older, more inclusive notions, so that cultural studies, for instance, include, in addition to canonical works, popular and minority genres. The word is also used in reference to non-written works: to "oral literature" and "the literature of preliterate culture".

A value judgment definition of literature considers it as consisting solely of high quality writing that forms part of the belles-lettres ("fine writing") tradition. An example of this is in the 1910–1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, which classified literature as "the best expression of the best thought reduced to writing".

The use of the term "literature" here is a little problematic because of its origins in the Latin littera, "letter", essentially writing. Alternatives such as "oral forms" and "oral genres" have been suggested but the word literature is widely used.

Australian Aboriginal culture has thrived on oral traditions and oral histories passed down through tens of thousands of years. In a study published in February 2020, new evidence showed that both Budj Bim and Tower Hill volcanoes erupted between 34,000 and 40,000 years ago. Significantly, this is a "minimum age constraint for human presence in Victoria", and also could be interpreted as evidence for the oral histories of the Gunditjmara people, an Aboriginal Australian people of south-western Victoria, which tell of volcanic eruptions being some of the oldest oral traditions in existence. An axe found underneath volcanic ash in 1947 had already proven that humans inhabited the region before the eruption of Tower Hill.

Oral literature is an ancient human tradition found in "all corners of the world". Modern archaeology has been unveiling evidence of the human efforts to preserve and transmit arts and knowledge that depended completely or partially on an oral tradition, across various cultures:

The Judeo-Christian Bible reveals its oral traditional roots; medieval European manuscripts are penned by performing scribes; geometric vases from archaic Greece mirror Homer's oral style. () Indeed, if these final decades of the millennium have taught us anything, it must be that oral tradition never was the other we accused it of being; it never was the primitive, preliminary technology of communication we thought it to be. Rather, if the whole truth is told, oral tradition stands out as the single most dominant communicative technology of our species as both a historical fact and, in many areas still, a contemporary reality.

William Shakespeare is known for 150 sonnets. A sonnet is composed of fourteen lines with a rhyming scheme. The Bard has shown that poem composition can be done in such a manner while still maintaining the integrity of the thought. Where most people can expel a thought that rhymes (one need only to think of nursery rhymes like “Mary had a little lamb”), William Shakespeare has done so with careful attention to the subject matter and the overall flow and thought of the poem. In his very first sonnet we can see how his ability to do so has rightly earned him the esteemed position of the status quo.

Compared to the diversity of some of the later poets, one may think that William Shakespeare’s poems are a bit lacking in their subject scope. However, one would do well to consider the time era from whence these poems were written. During this era, literary professionals were hard pressed to make a living. Plays (for which William Shakespeare is best known) were looked upon more as a hobby than a professional career and so the money for such works was not substantial to live off of. Poems were considered to be something for the nobles and upper society. Being that parchment was also considered to be a sacred material at that time (mainly due to the scarcity to secure large quantities at one time), the lines of the poems written had to be catered specifically to sell. What better to sell than a love sonnet during the Elizabethan Era?

Unknown to a great many, are the two narrative poems of William Shakespeare. These two poems were written around the same time period (1593 and 1594) of his career. It could be concluded that these two poems were composed as a test. Being that there are no other narratives it can also be concluded that William Shakespeare did not see the merit in composing such lengthy poems and therefore focused on where money could be made. It is only in the later years after an artist is gone that the cultural world seems to embrace the artistry of one’s work. It would appear that such rings true with these two poems.

The earlier of the two poems, William Shakespeare truly shows that he can present a story in poetic form. The poem was constructed for as he put it “so noble a god-father”, the earl of Southampton. Again, we see that there is the strong story of love and conflict which tends to radiate throughout his work. However, another key aspect of William Shakespeare’s work can be seen here and that is his use of the mythological. Where Venus is a common mythological deity, one will find that other such beings are introduced not only in his sonnets and poems but also within his plays. With such, here lies the tie with the ancient muses and the Elizabethan poets.

Not uncommon to William Shakespeare, this poem focuses on a murder and the pursuit of lover. One can see the clear association with his play Hamlet (written around 1590) as well as Macbeth (written around 1603) within this work. Being as the poem was written early in his career, one may conclude that this poem served as a starting point for the later plays. It would be foolish for the seasoned reader not to conclude that such associations with these later works were deliberately constructed from the format and content of this work.

Those which are looking for a poet to aspire to would do well to follow the writings of William Shakespeare. The sonnets allow the poet to practice tactful word play while the narrative poems provide us with an exercise in intricate storytelling.

Readers of poetry would be greatly benefited from reading the sonnets of Shakespeare. Many of the “modern” poets have read and in some cases mimicked his work very closely. As a serious poet, one cannot abandon the building blocks for which the poetic area was built. Being that William Shakespeare has earned the title “The Bard”, we would all be wise to listen with earnestness to the words he has written.

Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do. On the one hand the standard of right and wrong, on the other the chain of causes and effects, are fastened to their throne. They govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all we think: every effort we can make to throw off our subjection, will serve but to demonstrate and confirm it. In words a man may pretend to abjure their empire: but in reality he will remain subject to it all the while. The principle of utility recognises this subjection, and assumes it for the foundation of that system, the object of which is to rear the fabric of felicity by the hands of reason and of law.

People might dress it up with words like ‘duty’ or ‘virtue’, but when you get right down to the fundamental drivers of why we act the way we do, ultimately we all want more pleasure, and we all want less pain. Happiness for each of us is simply constituted by the aggregate balance of the former over the latter.

The strength of his utilitarianism, Bentham thinks, is that it accepts this fact of human nature, and incorporates it into a secular ethical system: doing the right thing means performing so-called ‘hedonic calculus’ to ensure we act in ways that bring about more pleasure than pain.

Bentham’s philosophy was built on by the 19th-century thinkers John Stuart Mill and Henry Sidgwick, both of whom developed classical utilitarianism with further clarifications on how we might calculate the right thing to do.

Sidgwick, for instance, emphasized the importance of impartiality in our calculations — and this is where utilitarianism departs from Epicureanism.

For, while Epicurus also wants us to weigh pain and pleasure and perform ‘hedonic calculus’, he advises us to do so from our own perspectives — i.e. by asking ‘what acts will lead to the best long-term consequences for my mental health?’

We must subtract our personal biases or investments away from the situations we encounter, and simply add our own happiness or suffering to the communal pile when considering the right thing to do.

Utilitarianism has since developed beyond the ‘classical’ theories of Bentham, Mill, and Sidgwick, and there are more branches than the hedonistic variety.

Some of those branches, for instance, emphasize preferences rather than pleasure; some suggest agent-relative weightings; and some soften the maximal demand of doing the most good to doing ‘enough’ good.

Regardless of the differences in emphasis that can be found in the movement, the important takeaway is that utilitarianism is a philosophy that claims morality depends entirely on outcomes.

To work out the best path forward, utilitarians say, we must consider not which action we think is ‘inherently’ good or virtuous, but which action will produce the best results — which will lead to more ‘good’ in the world (pleasure, happiness, preference-fulfillment) and less ‘bad’ (pain or suffering).

The only thing you will learn from all this will be to want still more. The desires implanted by nature [i.e. for food, water, human connection] have a limit, but those born from false opinion have no way of reaching an end

If we measure ourselves according to external status symbols, we will never be satisfied ― for where does it end?

The upshot, then, is that if we are to possibly feel at peace in life, we cannot allow ourselves to be enslaved by desires that are impossible to fulfill.

Of course, we need money and resources to survive; Seneca is not denying this. His point is simply not to confuse ‘survive’ with ‘thrive’.

If we have enough resources so that our natural desires (and those of our dependents) are reliably met, then why bother seeking more? What’s it all actually for?

If we dedicate our (only) lives to the accumulation of status and resources, we climb aboard a golden treadmill, frantically moving but not actually going anywhere.

We cannot stand prepared for death if we are just beginning to live. We must instead make sure that we have already lived enough. And no one could think this about himself if he is forever involved in starting to live. You should not suppose that such people are few in number: almost everyone is like this. Indeed, they begin to live only when it is time to stop. If you think this strange, I will add something which will surprise you even more: some people leave off living before they have even begun

If the purpose of philosophy is to prepare us for death, as many of the ancients thought, then we can view Seneca’s words as a challenge.

Will we vainly, blindly strut upon the gilded treadmill of wealth and fame and resource accumulation, ever grasping forward but with no real destination in mind?

Or will we climb off, and with eyes wide open, appreciate the richness, the beauty, the joy of life that is right here before us, ready for us to claim it?

The paper describes some recent developments in neural networks and discusses the applicability of neural networks in the development of a machine that mimics the human brain. The paper mentions a new architecture, the pulsed neural network that is being considered as the next generation of neural networks. The paper also explores the use of memristors in the development of a brain-like computer called the MoNETA. A new model, infinite dimensional neural networks, are a recent development in the area of advanced neural networks. The paper concludes that the need of neural networks in the development of human-like technology is essential and may be non-expendable for it.

Neural networks are capable of handling a wide variety of the type of problems which involve finding trends in large quantities of data. They are better suited than traditional computer architecture to handling problems that humans are naturally good at and which computers are not able to handle very well. For example, pattern recognition, generalizing, clustering, etc., are problems which humans handle better than computers and so do neural networks. Research is also focused in the direction of developing new models of neural networks that are better at solving these problems. Certain problems remain to be solved

Wolfgang Maass has identified three generations of past and current artificial neural network research and makes the following observations. The first generation has the McCulloch-Pitts neuron (also known as a perceptron or a threshold-gate) as the basic unit of computation. Models of the first generation, such as the multi-layer perceptron, use digital input and output, either binary or bipolar. A Boolean function can be computed by using a multi-layer perceptron with a single hidden layer. The second generation has as its basis computation units (neurons) that use an activation function of a continuous set of possible output values. Commonly, these activation functions are the sigmoid, or the hyperbolic tangent. Second generation neural networks can also compute any boolean function by using a threshold. Second generation network are capable of computing certain boolean functions with fewer neurons than first generation neural networks. Further, second generation networks with one hidden layer can approximate any continuous, analog function. Also, second generation networks support learning algorithms based on gradient descent, such as error back-propagation.

Make love, blackbrows,
But not with Muscovites,
Because Muscovites are strangers,
They make trouble with you.
Moskal loves to joke,
Joking will quit;
He will go to his Moscow region,
And the girl dies -
If I were alone, there would be nothing,
And the old mother
What brought into the world of God,
Must die.
The heart withers while singing
When knows for what;
People will not see the heart
And they will say - lazy!
Make love, black-browed,
But not with Muscovites,
Because Muscovites are strangers,
They make fun of you.

Kateryna did not listen
Neither father nor mother,
I fell in love with the moskalika,
As the heart knew.
I fell in love with a young man
I went to kindergarten
While yourself, your destiny
There was an attack.

Gave birth to mother son
In the green forest,
Gave you brown eyes
And black eyebrows.
I was waving Chinese
Blessed all the saints,
May all things be holy
Talan-share was sent.
"Let's go you mother of God
This grace,
All that mother
The date doesn’t matter.”
Before the sun went down I took water,
I bathed in the periwinkle,
It swayed until midnight,
I sang until the light:

“Eelu-li,
Nourished Zozuli,
Zozulya Kuvala,
She told the truth.
I will live a hundred years,
You're a year old
Walk in the zhupani,
I will panuvati.
Oh virostesh, sinu,
For pivchvarta rock,
Yak prince ditina,
The tall yak is clear,
Gnuchky and stout,
Happy, cheerful
I am not alone.
I will find your equal
I want beyond the blue sea.
Or kramarivna,
Or centurion,
Taki pannu, sinu.
In the red booties,
In the green country
According to the light it looks like
Yak peahen, yak lady,
She is speaking to you.
In the house, like in heaven!!
And I'm sitting on the sidelines,
I’ll just take a look.

Oh my goodness, my goodness,
My baby!
What is the greatest in the whole world,
All over Ukraine!
There won’t be anything beautiful -
Marvel, people!
There’s nothing good! but a share
You will get a share."
Oh zozule, zozulenko,
Nascho you took a bite,
For these long years,
Have you been drinking for a hundred years?
Who is there in this world?
Hearing share?
Oh, yakbi I would have melted my mother
From the German field
Call your kids
І share, і will,
Ta ba and evil lack of talent
Get involved everywhere -
I on the way, and without the way,
Here, people.
I was rocking my mother's blues,
Like a flower in the garden,
I was shaking and this time
Father is dying.
Remained a success
I want to be young,
I’m not alone but it’s still hard
With grief and sorrow
Let's go to the neighbors
Please ask
Awarded by sisdonki
Hires to serve.
Depleted, depleted,
Threw it to the Lord
I went to hire didn’t pass
It will come in handy.
I worked day and night,
I paid my soul
I sons for three kopecks
I bought some zhupanok.
Just in case, please,
I walked to school.

Oh talane, talane,
Goddamn the filth!
You are in the field, you are in the fields,
Ripped off gypsies,
Are you walking with barge haulers?
Water flows up the mountain
Bagatomu to the hut.
And God needs it in the yard
Krinitsyu kopati.
The rich grow up with children -
Verbi near the valley;
And the widow has one,
That's it, like Bilina.

The widow was waiting for her share,
The growth of that son.
І written, і verbal -
Little baby!
It's like God is behind the door,
Panuvala widow;
And the girls looked at each other
І towels dbali.
I fell in love with the rich man -
Didn't kiss
I sewed the hustka with a seam -
I didn’t give it as a gift.
The evil ones were sneaking from across the sea
In my house.
They crept up The boys became
In kaidan kuwati
They took me to the reception
Bitimi shlyakhami.
The widow went with her mothers
With many tears.
They stopped for nothing,
They gave the watchman
Old widow before the convoy
They weren't allowed.
Oh they brought it to the reception
Chuprin goliti;
All are small, all are small,
All rich children.
Toy Kalika Nedorika,
That doesn't matter.
That hunchback, that rich one,
Quietly in the house.
All bad, all gone back,
The mother's share is in everything.
And the widow has one son,
The same one is right next to the arshin.
I left my house,
To the Lord Sinov;
Went to hire for stale bread
Jews carry water.
Bo baptisms are not accepted:
“Old,” it seems, “has become,
I’m unwell” - and ogrizok
Served in vikno
For Christ's sake. God forbid
To live like this
God forbid, in a rich man
And ask for a drink.
I paid a copy,
I collected a lot of money.
She wrote a leaf until the blue,
The military sent -
Feel better. The river is passing,
And the other one is passing,
I quarter, I tenth,
But it’s a bit mute.
Mutely sensitive; What's there to do here?
Need a bag of brothers
And go and tease the dogs
Od hati do hati.
I took the bag and went to the village,
On the side of the village
I didn’t return to the village anymore,
I sat day and night
Kolo kvorot. And summer
It fades away in the summer.
Faded, scaled,
No one knows.
Who's there to know?
Kalika is poor.
Sit by yourself and marvel
In the field on the road.
It’s shining and it’s getting dark,
And it’s getting dark again,
And the Muscovite, the son,
No, no.

At the end of the evening
The outline is hidden.
Waiting for my son's mother
Have supper until dawn.
At the end of the evening
The sedge whispers.
Waiting in the dark
Cossack girl.
As the wind blows,
Lozi is nagging.
Crying mother alone in the hut,
And the girl is in hell.
Blackbrow cried
She began to sleep;
The old mother cried
She became a ridati.
I prayed and gave,
I cursed everything in the world.
Oh, you are hard, you are untalented
The mother has children!
Scaled old hands
I'm crazy
I cursed my share,
Sina was talking.
It’s a pity that I left
I was scolding
That on the way that on the distant
Kriz was amazed with tears.
I marveled day and night
She began to feed:
“Chi not chuv hto, chi not bachiv
Muscovite soldier,
My son?” I don’t feel anyone,
I don’t care about anyone.
Stay out, don't go to the village,
Don't feed and don't cry,
Stupid! and tseglina
Drill, then bark,
That year, like a child,
He calls him a son,
And very quietly
Kryz sleeps with tears:

“The snake set the house on fire,
I made porridge for the children,
She wrinkled her eyes,
The Muscovites flew away.
Gray geese in Ireland, Ireland
According to Chotiri, according to Chotiri
Let's fly - gel-gel! —
There is an eagle on the grave,
At the grave in the middle of the night
The Cossack has clear eyes,
And the girl in the dark
This is how you look.”

This day I climbed on smitniki,
I collected shards
Primovlyala that my sons
The hotel was great.
And the night of Rose Christian
І simple-haired
Walking around the village - then he sleeps,
It's scary to voice.
People were barking bo, bachte,
Didn't let them sleep
That sprinkle under their mud
I trampled the Buryan.
Children ran with sticks
Pull for the widow
Along the streets, smiling
They teased with an owl.

I'm past thirteen.
I grazed lambs outside the village.
Is that how the sun shone
Is something wrong with me?
I love it so much, I love it
As if by God.
Already called to share
And I'm in the weeds
I pray to God. And I don't know
Why little me
Then it was praying so kindly,
What was so much fun?
God's sky, and the village,
The lamb seemed to be having fun!
And the sun was warm, not hot!
But the sun didn't shine for long,
I prayed for a short time.
It burned, turned red
And heaven lit up.
As soon as I woke up, I looked:
The village turned black
God's sky is blue
And that was wasted.
I looked at the lambs!
Not my lambs!
I turned to the house -
I don't have a house!
God did not give me anything!
And tears flowed
Heavy tears! And the girl
By the road itself
Not far from me
Ploskin chose
Yes, she heard that I was crying.
Came, greeted
She wiped my tears
And kissed 

As if the sun shone,
As if everything in the world has become
My. meadows, groves, gardens!
And we, jokingly, drove away
Stranger's lambs to the water.

Brydnya! and still, as I recall,
That heart cries and hurts,
Why didn't God let him live
I was young in that paradise.
I would die plowing in the field,
I would not know anything in the world.
I wouldn't be a fool in the world,
He did not curse people or God!

Your name is like a silver sound of trumpets,
You are always in front of us in Borni per day.
Millions of hands carried you to the sky,
So that you sow like a banner over the ages.

You lead us, as you led us long ago
To victories, speeding up time and further.
When the hearts of millions melt into one -
This heart will be yours, dear Stalin!

The cities are buzzing, and the sun is shining again and again
A dove rises for us in the distance.
The motherland sends its love to you,
Like every heart full of you.

My land blooms like a battle song.
In the light of the stars and in the groves bezhury.
You did this - this is your party,
This is each of us, born for the storm.

Not in vain, no, with battles the edge of the grime -
Gone are the days of poverty and bad weather.
In the roar of factories and farms
Accept this song of the happy people.

Receive it in this sunny time,
So that he thunders about you clearly.
You give us light, lead us to the future,
A beacon of ages and the glory of millions.

Whether singing or step of manifestations,
or the roar of engines from above
in the noise of warm acacias,
always, always between us you are.

Is the train flowing in the noise of the cedars
and flew over the bridges with a roar,
is the battle thundering for the homeland, -
always, always between us you are.

Does the traveler walk in the field,
and the sky changes and the sun, -
lips whisper carelessly
your name.

Or over the northern ocean,
where the glow of joyful flowers
republic titans fly, —
always, always between us you are.

As with the daylight of the ear of corn,
as with gentle sight the sight of fire,
your name is clearly confused
with the name of your associate.

Angry, inspired and winged,
like a call of fire in battles,
with the name of an associate and a brother
your name.

Думи мої, думи мої,
Лихо мені з вами!
Нащо стали на папері
Сумними рядами?
Чом вас вітер не розвіяв
В степу, як пилину?
Чом вас лихо не приспало,
Як свою дитину?

Бо вас лихо на світ на сміх породило,
Поливали сльози Чом не затопили,
Не винесли в море, не розмили в полі?
Не питали б люди, що в мене болить,
Не питали б, за що проклинаю долю,
Чого нужу світом? «Нічого робить», —
Не сказали б на сміх

Квіти мої, діти!
Нащо вас кохав я, нащо доглядав?
Чи заплаче серце одно на всім світі,
Як я з вами плакав? Може, і вгадав

Може, найдеться дівоче
Серце, карі очі,
Що заплачуть на сі думи —
Я більше не хочу
Одну сльозу з очей карих —
І пан над панами!
Думи мої, думи мої!
Лихо мені з вами!

За карії оченята,
За чорнії брови
Серце рвалося, сміялось,
Виливало мову,
Виливало, як уміло,
За темнії ночі,
За вишневий сад зелений,
За ласки дівочі
За степи та за могили,
Що на Україні,
Серце мліло, не хотіло
Співать на чужині
Не хотілось в снігу, в лісі,
Козацьку громаду
З булавами, з бунчугами
Збирать на пораду
Нехай душі козацькії
В Украйні витають —
Там широко, там весело
Од краю до краю
Як та воля, що минулась,
Дніпр широкий — море,
Степ і степ, ревуть пороги,
І могили — гори.
Там родилась, гарцювала
Козацькая воля;
Там шляхтою, татарами
Засівала поле,
Засівала трупом поле,
Поки не остило
Лягла спочить А тим часом
Виросла могила,
А над нею орел чорний
Сторожем літає,
І про неї добрим людям
Кобзарі співають,
Все співають, як діялось,
Сліпі небораки,
Бо дотепні А я А я
Тілько вмію плакать,
Тілько сльози за Украйну
А слова — немає
А за лихо Та цур йому!
Хто його не знає!
А надто той, що дивиться
На людей душою —
Пекло йому на сім світі,
А на тім
Журбою
Не накличу собі долі,
Коли так не маю.
Нехай злидні живуть три дні —
Я їх заховаю,
Заховаю змію люту
Коло свого серця,
Щоб вороги не бачили,
Як лихо сміється
Нехай думка, як той ворон,
Літає та кряче,
А серденько соловейком
Щебече та плаче
Нишком — люди не побачуть,
То й не засміються
Не втирайте ж мої сльози,
Нехай собі ллються,
Чуже поле поливають
Щодня і щоночі,
Поки, поки не засиплють
Чужим піском очі
Отаке-то А що робить?
Журба не поможе.
Хто ж сироті завидує —
Карай того, Боже!

Думи мої, думи мої,
Квіти мої, діти!
Виростав вас, доглядав вас —
Де ж мені вас діти?
В Україну ідіть, діти!
В нашу Україну,
Попідтинню, сиротами,
А я тут загину.
Там найдете щире серце
І слово ласкаве,
Там найдете щиру правду,
А ще, може, й славу

Привітай же, моя ненько!
Моя Україно!
Моїх діток нерозумних,
Як свою дитину.
